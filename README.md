# Podcast Easy
Application for downloading podcasts. Versions are available for Python 2.7, Python 3, QPython3 (Android) and [Windows](https://github.com/r57zone/PodcastEasy).


Add RSS feeds to a file `RSS.txt` and run the program. After successful completion of the program change the value `DownloadFiles` in `PodcastEasy.py` file from `False` to `True` (60 line for 2.7, 54 for 3 and 53 for QPython3). Change is necessary for the first time to not download all the podcasts from the RSS feeds.


From time to time (once every 2-4 months), it is advisable to clean the database of outdated links to the search for new podcasts not slowing down. To do this, just run `RemOutdatedLinks.py` script.
